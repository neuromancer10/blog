# Starting to blog 

with `mk-docs` on `Github` in english...

Since I have never done this before lets talk about why I always wanted to do that:

## Sharing progress

Almost every day I encounter something that has nothing to do with work, has nothing to do with any personal matters that I should be thinking about - but still, is so interesting to me
that I do think about it at least for half an hour. Any results of these endeauvers are forgotten for the most part. And that is a pity.
I do want to have a memory of those thougts even if they are silly sometimes.

## Completing things

Writing about progress and projects hopefully will help with two other things besides memory loss:

- Starting new projects that have potential
- Finishing projects
