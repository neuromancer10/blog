# First post

**Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu**

As you probably read on the welcome page, this page is evidence for my success in setting up a few things:

- a git repository
- a folder structure for a `mk-docs-material` blog
- a local `mk-docs` `Docker` container for testing
- a `CI` script for `Github Actions` - even if I just `ctrl-c` `ctrl-v` it

So this first post will be a the final test if everything works.
